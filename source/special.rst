Special Protocols
=================

This section defines three Protocols, each of which serves a special
purpose in a Greybus system.

The first is the Control Protocol.  <GYBS.R.0201.001>Every Interface 
shall provide a CPort that uses the Control Protocol.</GYBS.R.0201.001> 
It is used by the AP Module to notify Interfaces when connections are 
available for them to use.

The second is the SVC Protocol, which is used only between the SVC
and AP Module.  The SVC provides low-level control of the |unipro|
network.  The SVC performs almost all of its activities under
direction of the AP Module, and the SVC Protocol is used by the AP
Module to exert this control.  The SVC also uses this protocol to
notify the AP Module of events, such as the insertion or removal of
a Module.

The third is the Firmware Protocol, which is used between the AP Module and any
other module's bootloader to download firmware executables to the module.  
<GYBS.A.0201.001>When a module's manifest includes a CPort using the 
Firmware Protocol, the AP can connect to that CPort and download a firmware 
executable to the module.</GYBS.A.0201.001>

.. _control-protocol:

Control Protocol
----------------

<GYBS.R.0202.001>All Interfaces are required to define a CPort that uses 
the Control Protocol, and shall be prepared to receive Operation requests 
on that CPort at any time.</GYBS.R.0202.001> The CPort that uses the 
Control Protocol must have an id of '0'. CPort id '0' is a reserved CPort 
address for the Control Protocol. Similarly the bundle descriptor 
associated with the Control CPort must have an id of '0'. Bundle id '0' 
is a reserved id for the Control Protocol bundle descriptor.

A Greybus connection is established whenever a control connection is used,
but the Interface is never notified that such a connection exists. 
<GYBS.R.0203.001>Only the AP Module is able to send control requests. Any 
other Interface shall only send control response messages, and such 
messages shall only be sent in reply to a request received on its 
control CPort.</GYBS.R.0203.001>

Conceptually, the Operations in the Greybus Control Protocol are:

.. c:function:: int version(u8 offer_major, u8 offer_minor, u8 *major, u8 *minor);

    Negotiates the major and minor version of the Protocol used for
    communication over the connection.  The AP offers the
    version of the Protocol it supports.  The Interface replies with
    the version that will be used--either the one offered if
    supported or its own (lower) version otherwise.  Protocol
    handling code adhering to the Protocol specified herein supports
    major version |gb-major|, minor version |gb-minor|.

.. c:function:: int get_manifest_size(u16 *size);

    This Operation is used by the AP to discover the size of a module's
    Interface Manifest.  This is used after the SVC has discovered which
    Module contains the AP.  The response to this Operation contains the
    size of the manifest, which is used by the AP to fetch the manifest
    later.  This operation is only initiated by the AP.

.. c:function:: int get_manifest(u8 *manifest);

    This Operation is used by the AP after the SVC has discovered
    which Module contains the AP.  The response to this Operation
    contains the manifest of the Module, which is used by the AP to
    determine the functionality module provides.  This operation is only
    initiated by the AP.

.. c:function:: int connected(u16 cport_id);

    This Operation is used to notify an Interface that a Greybus
    connection has been established using the indicated CPort.
    <GYBS.R.0204.001>Upon receiving this request, an Interface
    shall be prepared to receive messages on the indicated 
    CPort.</GYBS.R.0204.001>  <GYBS.P.0201.001>The Interface may send 
    messages over the indicated CPort once it has sent a response to
    the connected request.</GYBS.P.0201.001>  This operation is never 
    used for control CPort.

.. c:function:: int disconnected(u16 cport_id);

    This Operation is used to notify an Interface that a previously 
    established Greybus connection may no longer be used. This operation
    is never used for control CPort.

Greybus Control Operations

Greybus Control Disconnected Response
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. _svc-protocol:

SVC Protocol
------------

The AP Module is required to provide a CPort that uses the SVC
Protocol on an Interface. The AP Module does not have a control
connection, but instead implements the SVC protocol using the
reserved Control CPort ID. At initial power-on, the SVC sets up a
|unipro| connection from one of its CPorts to the AP Module
Interface's SVC CPort.

The SVC has direct control over and responsibility for the Endo,
including detecting when modules are present, configuring the
|unipro| switch, powering module Interfaces, and attaching and
detaching modules.  The AP Module controls the Endo through
operations sent over the SVC connection.  And the SVC informs the AP
Module about Endo events (such as the presence of a new module, or
notification of changing power conditions).

Conceptually, the operations in the Greybus SVC Protocol are:

.. c:function:: int version(u8 offer_major, u8 offer_minor, u8 *major, u8 *minor);

    Negotiates the major and minor version of the Protocol used for
    communication over the connection.  The SVC offers the
    version of the Protocol it supports.  The AP replies with
    the version that will be used--either the one offered if
    supported or its own (lower) version otherwise.  Protocol
    handling code adhering to the Protocol specified herein supports
    major version |gb-major|, minor version |gb-minor|.

.. c:function:: int svc_hello(u16 endo_id, u8 intf_id);

    This Operation is used at initial power-on, sent by the SVC to
    inform the AP of its environment. After version negotiation,
    it is the next operation initiated by the SVC sent at
    initialization. The descriptor describes details of the endo
    environment such as number, placement, and features of interface
    blocks, etc.

.. c:function:: int dme_peer_get(u8 intf_id, u16 attribute, u16 selector, u16 *result_code, u32 *value);

    This Operation is used by the AP to direct the SVC to perform a
    |unipro| DME peer get on its behalf. The SVC returns the value
    of the DME attribute requested.

.. c:function:: int dme_peer_set(u8 intf_id, u16 attribute, u16 selector, u32 value, u16 *result_code);

    This Operation is used by the AP to direct the SVC to perform a
    |unipro| DME peer set on its behalf.

.. c:function:: int route_create(u8 intf1_id, u8 intf2_id);

    This Operation is used by the AP to direct the SVC to create
    a route for |unipro| traffic between two interfaces.

.. c:function:: int route_destroy(u8 intf1_id, u8 intf2_id);

    This Operation is used by the AP to direct the SVC to destroy
    a route for |unipro| traffic between two interfaces.

.. c:function:: int intf_device_id(u8 intf_id, u8 device_id);

    This operation is used by the AP Module to request that the SVC
    associate a device ID with the given Interface.

.. c:function:: int intf_hotplug(u8 intf_id, u32 unipro_mfg_id, u32 unipro_prod_id, u32 ara_vend_id, u32 ara_prod_id);

    The SVC sends this to the AP Module to inform it that it has
    detected a module on the indicated Interface.  It supplies some information
    that describes the module that has been attached.

.. XXX We may need to adjust based on whether detect is associated
.. XXX with a module (as opposed to an Interface).

.. c:function:: int intf_hotunplug(u8 intf_id);

    The SVC sends this to the AP Module to tell it that a module is
    no longer present on an Interface.

.. c:function:: int intf_reset(u8 intf_id);

    The SVC sends this to inform the AP Module that an active
    Interface needs to be reset.  This might happen when the SVC has
    detected
    an error on the link, for example.

.. XXX This is nebulous at this point; my intention is to handle the
.. XXX case where a UniPro "link down" indicates that a link *was*
.. XXX down at some point--since we have no way to discover this
.. XXX immediately.

.. c:function:: int connection_create(u8 intf1_id, u16 cport1_id, u8 intf2_id, u16 cport2_id, u8 tc, u8 flags);

    The AP Module uses this operation to request the SVC set up a
    |unipro| connection between CPorts on two Interfaces.

.. c:function:: int connection_destroy(u8 intf1_id, u16 cport1_id, u8 intf2_id, u16 cport2_id);

    The AP Module uses this operation to request the SVC tear down a
    previously created connection.

Firmware Protocol
-----------------

The Greybus Firmware Protocol is used by a module's bootloader to communicate
with the AP and download firmware executables via |unipro| when a module does
not have its own firmware pre-loaded.

The operations in the Greybus Firmware Protocol are:

.. c:function:: int version(u8 offer_major, u8 offer_minor, u8 *major, u8 *minor);

    Negotiates the major and minor version of the Protocol used for
    communication over the connection.  The AP sends the request offering the
    version of the Protocol it supports.  <GYBS.R.0212.001>The module responds 
    with the version that shall be used--either the one offered if supported, 
    or its own lower version.</GYBS.R.0212.001>  Protocol handling code 
    adhering to the Protocol specified here supports major 
    version |gb-major|, minor version |gb-minor|.

.. c:function:: int firmware_size(u8 stage, u32 *size);

    The module requests from the AP the size of the firmware it must
    load, specifying the stage of the boot sequence for which the module is
    requesting firmware.  The AP then locates a suitable firmware blob,
    associates that firmware blob with the requested boot stage until it next
    receives a firmware size request, and responds with the blob's size in
    bytes, which must be nonzero.

.. c:function:: int get_firmware(u32 offset, u32 size, void *data);

    The module requests a finite stream of bytes in the firmware blob
    from the AP, passing its current offset into the firmware blob, and the size
    of the stream it currently needs.  The AP responds with exactly the number
    of bytes requested, taken from the firmware blob currently associated with
    this connection at the specified offset.

.. c:function:: int ready_to_boot(u8 status);

    The module implementing the Protocol requests permission from the AP to jump
    into the firmware blob it has loaded.  The request sent to the AP includes a
    status indicating whether the retrieved firmware blob is valid and secure,
    valid but insecure, or invalid.  The AP decides whether to permit the module
    to boot in its current condition: if so, it sends a success code in its
    response's status byte, otherwise it sends an error code in its response's
    status byte.

Greybus Firmware Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Table :num:`table-firmware-operation-type` describes the Greybus firmware
operation types and their values.  A message type consists of an operation type

get firmware request payload.  The request specifies an offset into the firmware
blob, and the size of the stream of bytes requested.  <GYBS.R.0214.001>The 
stream size requested must be less than or equal to the size given by the 
most recent firmware size response (:ref:`firmware-size-response`) minus 
the offset; when it is not, the AP shall signal an error in its 
response.</GYBS.R.0214.001>  The module is responsible for tracking its 
offset into the firmware blob as needed.

Greybus Firmware Ready to Boot Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Greybus Firmware ready to boot operation lets the requesting module notify
the AP that it has successfully loaded the connection's currently-associated
firmware blob and is able to hand over control of the processor to that blob,
indicating the status of its firmware blob.  <GYBS.R.0216.001>The AP shall 
then send a response empty of payload, indicating via the header's status byte 
whether or not it permits the module to continue booting.</GYBS.R.0216.001>

<GYBS.R.0217.001>The module shall send a ready to boot request only when 
it has successfully loaded a firmware blob and can execute that 
firmware.</GYBS.R.0217.001>
